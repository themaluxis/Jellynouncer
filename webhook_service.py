Jellynouncer Webhook Service Module

This module contains the main WebhookService class that serves as the central orchestrator
for all Jellynouncer functionality. It coordinates between Jellyfin webhooks, change
detection, database management, and Discord notifications to provide a complete media
notification service.

The WebhookService acts as the "conductor" of the application, managing the flow of data
between all other components and ensuring they work together harmoniously.

class WebhookService:
    """
    Main webhook service orchestrator that coordinates all application components.

    Think of this class as the "conductor" of an orchestra - it doesn't play any
    instruments itself, but it coordinates all the other "musicians" (components)
    to create a harmonious performance. The WebhookService manages the entire
    flow of data from Jellyfin webhooks through to Discord notifications.

    The service handles several key responsibilities:
    - Service initialization and configuration management
    - Background maintenance tasks (database cleanup, health monitoring)
    - Webhook processing from Jellyfin (the main event loop)
    - Library synchronization with Jellyfin
    - Health monitoring and diagnostics
    - Graceful shutdown procedures

    The service follows an async-first design pattern, meaning most operations
    are asynchronous (non-blocking) to handle multiple webhook requests
    simultaneously without slowing down.

    **Understanding Async/Await:**
        The `async` and `await` keywords are Python's way of handling concurrent
        operations. When a method is marked `async`, it means it can be paused
        and resumed, allowing other operations to run while waiting for slow
        operations (like network requests or database queries) to complete.

    **The Orchestrator Pattern:**
        This class implements the "orchestrator" or "service coordinator" pattern.
        Instead of having components directly communicate with each other, they
        all report to this central coordinator which manages their interactions.
        This makes the system easier to maintain and debug.

    Attributes:
        logger (logging.Logger): Main application logger for tracking operations
        config (AppConfig): Validated application configuration from files/environment
        db (DatabaseManager): Database manager for storing media item information
        jellyfin (JellyfinAPI): Jellyfin API client for communicating with media server
        change_detector (ChangeDetector): Logic for detecting meaningful media changes
        discord (DiscordNotifier): Discord notification manager for sending messages
        metadata_service (MetadataService): Service for fetching external metadata information

    Service State Tracking:
        last_vacuum (float): Timestamp of last database maintenance operation
        server_was_offline (bool): Whether Jellyfin server was previously offline
        sync_in_progress (bool): Whether library sync is currently running
        is_background_sync (bool): Whether current sync is running in background
        initial_sync_complete (bool): Whether initial startup sync finished
        shutdown_event (asyncio.Event): Coordination signal for graceful shutdown

    Example:
        Basic service lifecycle:
        ```python
        # Create and initialize the service
        service = WebhookService()
        await service.initialize()

        # Process a webhook from Jellyfin
        webhook_payload = WebhookPayload(ItemId="123", Name="Movie", ...)
        result = await service.process_webhook(webhook_payload)
        logger.info(f"Processed {result['action']} for {result['item_name']}")

        # Check service health
        health = await service.health_check()
        logger.info(f"Service status: {health['status']}")

        # Clean up when shutting down
        await service.cleanup()
        ```

    Note:
        This class is designed to be a singleton - only one instance should
        exist per application to avoid conflicts with shared resources like
        the database and background tasks.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize webhook service with logging and configuration loading.

        This constructor handles the early initialization steps that must happen
        synchronously (without async/await). The heavy lifting of async operations
        happens later in the initialize() method.

        **Why Two-Phase Initialization?**
            Python constructors (__init__) cannot be async, but we need to perform
            async operations like database connections and API calls. So we split
            initialization into two phases:
            1. __init__: Sync operations (logging, config loading, object creation)
            2. initialize(): Async operations (database setup, API connections)

        **Understanding Component Initialization:**
            We initialize all component references to None and populate them during
            the async initialize() method. This ensures clean error handling and
            allows for proper resource management.

        Raises:
            SystemExit: If configuration loading or validation fails critically

        """
        Initialize all service components and establish connections.

        This async method handles the complex initialization process that requires
        network connections, database setup, and component coordination. It's
        designed to fail gracefully if any component cannot be initialized.

        **Initialization Steps:**
            1. Load and validate configuration from files and environment
            2. Initialize database manager and create/migrate tables
            3. Connect to Jellyfin API and verify authentication
            4. Set up Discord notification manager with webhooks
            5. Initialize external metadata services (OMDb, TMDb, TVDb)
            6. Create change detector for upgrade notifications
            7. Perform initial library sync if needed
            8. Start background maintenance tasks

        **Error Handling Strategy:**
            Each initialization step is wrapped in try/catch blocks to provide
            detailed error information. Critical failures will stop the service,
            while non-critical failures (like metadata services) will log warnings
            but allow the service to continue.

        This is the main entry point for webhook processing. It handles the entire

        including change detection, database updates, and error recovery.

        **Webhook Processing Pipeline:**
            1. Validate and extract media information from webhook payload
            2. Fetch additional metadata from Jellyfin API if needed

            7. Handle errors gracefully without breaking the service

        **Understanding the Workflow:**
            Not every webhook should result in a notification. The service needs
            to distinguish between:
            - New items that should always generate notifications

        Synchronize entire Jellyfin library to local database using streaming batch processing.

        This method performs a complete sync of the Jellyfin library using a producer-consumer
        pattern that streams batches from the API while concurrently processing them to the
        database. This provides optimal memory usage and performance for large libraries.

        **Streaming Architecture:**
            - Producer task: Fetches batches from Jellyfin API and queues them
            - Consumer task: Processes queued batches and saves to database
            - Concurrent execution with configurable queue size for backpressure
            - Memory-efficient: Only a few batches in memory at once

        **Enhanced Performance:**
            - Overlapping network I/O (API fetch) with database I/O (batch save)
            - True streaming: No accumulation of all items in memory
            - Real-time progress logging shows fetch and save operations
            - Partial progress saved even if sync fails midway

        **Background vs Foreground Sync:**
            - Background: Doesn't block webhook processing (for periodic syncs)
            - Foreground: Blocks webhook processing (for initial setup)

        Args:
            background (bool): Whether to run sync in background mode.
                Background syncs don't block webhook processing.

        Returns:
            Dict[str, Any]: Sync results including status, items processed, and timing

        Example:
            ```python
            # Perform initial sync (blocks webhooks)
            result = await service.sync_jellyfin_library(background=False)

            # Periodic sync (non-blocking)
            result = await service.sync_jellyfin_library(background=True)

            logger.info(f"Items processed: {result['items_processed']}")
            ```

        Note:
            This streaming implementation is suitable for libraries with millions of items,
            providing consistent memory usage regardless of library size.

        Check if initial sync is needed and perform it.

        This private method determines whether the service needs to perform
        an initial library sync. It's called during service initialization
        to ensure the database is populated with existing library content.

        **Initial Sync Logic:**
            The service creates a marker file after successful initial sync.
            If this marker doesn't exist, we perform initial sync to populate
            the database with existing Jellyfin library content.

        **Why Initial Sync Matters:**
            Without initial sync, all existing library items would be treated
            as "new" when webhooks are received, resulting in duplicate
            notifications for content that already existed.

        Note:
            This method runs a complete library sync and blocks webhook processing
            until it completes. It's only used on the very first service startup
            to populate the database with existing library content.

        **Why Block During Initial Sync?**
            We need a complete picture of the library before processing webhooks,
